# 📝 Contentus — Telegram AI Post Generator Bot

> ⚠️ This is an unfinished pet project. Around 60% of the planned features have been cut. But hey — it still works, and it's kinda cool.

## 🚧 What is this?

**Contentus** is a Telegram bot that I started building as a personal experiment.  
It was meant to be a full-featured AI assistant for Telegram channel creators — but in the end, I kept just the essentials:

- ✍️ You can generate posts using AI (OpenAI GPT)  
- 📌 You can link your Telegram channel  
- 🧾 You can add example posts so the bot learns your tone

That’s it. No admin panel, no scheduling, no tracking. Just post generation — fast and simple.

## 🧪 Why it exists

I was curious about how Telegram bots, OpenAI, and .NET could work together. I had big plans… and then lost interest halfway through 😅

The truth is:

- 🧱 I didn’t care about architecture — I didn’t really know what that was  
- 🧠 I was still learning C# and backend dev  
- 💡 I just wanted to see something *run* — and it did!

Now the bot just sits here, generating posts with surprising quality based on the linked channel info.

## 🛠 Features (implemented)

- Link a Telegram channel  
- Add example posts / channel description  
- Generate AI-written content based on your channel’s style  
- Use HTML formatting for better output in Telegram

## 🚫 What’s missing (and probably won’t happen)

- Weekly idea planner  
- Rewrite/Enhance/Edit tools  
- Multi-channel management  
- Proper security, validation, architecture, scalability... 😅

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **C# / .NET**
- **Telegram Bot API**
- **OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5**
- **SQLite** (for MVP) → maybe PostgreSQL one day

---

## 🤷‍♂️ Status

**Unmaintained.**  
I’m no longer actively working on this bot, but it still works as a minimal AI helper inside Telegram.

Feel free to fork, rewrite, improve, or just peek into the code and laugh at my early developer phase 😄

> It might be unfinished, but it helped me finish something: learning.
